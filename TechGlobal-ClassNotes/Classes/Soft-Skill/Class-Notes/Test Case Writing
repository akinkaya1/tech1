How to decide which test cases will be automated?

   System Architect, my developers and other testers from my team or other teams. In the test cases review based on the requirement we decide which test cases will be automated.

   Example: If there is a captcha requires image validation  and your automation can not detect required images.

Test  Cases process:

   After the sprint planning meeting, I share the user stories with other testers in my team. Next, I start writing my test cases based on the requirements (acceptance criteria). Then, I have test review meeting. I mark the test cases if they are automatable or manual.

   Based on that meeting I start writing my automation and I mark the test case status as in "Progress". After automation completed, I push my code and raise a MR (Merge Request). Now, I mark my test case as "On Review". At last, my MR is merged and I mark my Test Case as "Automated".
