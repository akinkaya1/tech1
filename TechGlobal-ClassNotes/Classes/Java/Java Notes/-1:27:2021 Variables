-We can use only characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’, ‘A’ to ‘Z’, numbers from ‘0’ to ‘9’, character ‘_’, and character ‘$’ for naming the variables

-A variable name cannot start with a digit (numbers from 0 to 9)
-A variable name cannot contain space  character



Which of those variables are going to compile?
int age; -> true, will compile
byte AGE; -> true, will compile
short shift$; -> true, will compile
byte number of students; -> false, will not compile
char _firstLetter; -> true, will compile
int 8students; -> false, will not compile
boolean isWheatherSnowing#; -> false, will not compile
double @balance; -> false, will not compile


2 WAYS TO DECLARE VARIABLES
	-There are 2 possible ways to declare a variable
    
    1.dataType variableName;
    -> this specifies its data type and reserves memory for it
    	EX/ short number;

    2.dataType variableName = initialValue;
    -> specifies its data type and reserves memory for it and puts
    and initial value into that memory. The initial value
    must be correct data type
    	EX/ double balance = 1000.50;

-DECLARING MULTIPLE VARIABLES
-Java allows to declare and initialize multiple variables in the same statement
int age1, age2;
byte number1 = 10, number2 = 20, number3 = 50;
-Many variables can be declared in the same statement if they are all same type
int num1, num2, num3 = 45, num4, num5;


boolean b1, b2; -> true, will compile
int i1 = 45, i2; -> true, will compile
double d1, double d2; -> false, will not compile 
byte b1; byte b2; -> true, will compile // Because these are 2 different statements

int i3; i4; false, will not compile // Because the second variable data type is missing

double d4; int age; true, will compile 


VARIABLE = FIELD
