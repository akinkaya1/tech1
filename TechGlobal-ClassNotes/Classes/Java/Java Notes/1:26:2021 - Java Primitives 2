1/26/2021 - Java Primitives continued

-8 different primitive data types
-byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

BYTE
-it takes 1 byte which means 8 bits
-min value -128
-max value 127

How can I read min/max value of a byte from Byte class?
		byte min = Byte.MIN_VALUE; //-128
        byte max = Byte.MAX_VALUE; //127

SHORT
-it takes 2 bytes which means 16 bits
-min value of short is -32768
-max value of short is 32767

System.out.println("Min value of short is: " + Short.MIN_VALUE);
System.out.println("Max value of short is: " + Short.MAX_VALUE);



NOTE:
-reduntant code = never used code in your program

NOTE: use this website for any issue that you get with your code
-stackoverflow
-huge community that answers tech issues
-GOOGLE is our best friend to ask questions
-Ask Google how to?


NOTE: we can make numbers more readable by using "_" underscore
EX/ int number = 5000000; or int number = 5_000_000; 
both will compile, run


INT 
-int stands for integer
-The min value of int variable can be -2147483648
-The max value of int variable can be 2147483647

LONG
-It takes 64 bits or 8 bytes of memory
-We have to explicitly put "L" to the end of long numbers
EX/ long number = 387246283672L;


FLOATING POINT TYPES = FLOAT AND DOUBLE
-float and double are used for floating points, decimal numbers
-these are to handle decimals
-we have to explicitly tell the float
	EX/ float f = 45.99F; or float f = 45.99f;
-double is the mostly preferred one


CHAR
-is a primitive data type that stores only 1 character
-In a program, a char is always surrounded with apostrophes (single quotations) ‘’ on both sides

EX/ char c = 'b'; or char c2 = '&';
