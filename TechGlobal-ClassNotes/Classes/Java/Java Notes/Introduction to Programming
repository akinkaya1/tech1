1/19/2021 - Introduction to Computer Programming

-Download Sublime Text
-It is a text editor that is mostly preferred by IT professional.
-We will store our class notes there




SDLC
-The aim is to get an end product
-Step by step prodecure to build the end product (application)

-Save money and time for the company

-Every application starts with an idea
-Idea is to solve a real life problem

-SOFTWARE 
Definition: is a set of instruction that tell computer what to do and how to do.

-We can not see software but we always feel
-Software: 2 types of software
1. System => Mac OS, Linux, Windows, Unix
2. Application => Uber, MS Office, Chrome, Paint, Adobe Acrobat Reader

- Software is written in a high-level computer programming language like Java, C, Pyhton, C++


-HARDWARE
-It is the body of the computer - every component of the computer that we can see and touch

Input devices: allows us enter data. Ex/ keyboard, scanner, microphone, webcam

Output devices: allows us to retrieve data. Ex/ printer, monitor, speakers

Pointing devices: allows us to point objects or icons on the screen. Ex/ Mouse, touchpad, touchscreen

Storage: allows us to store, retrieve, and save data. Ex/ hard-disk, memory cards, 

Other: RAM, CPU, CD-ROM



SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT - Engineers (SDE)

- One of the SDLC phase
- it comes after requirements, planning, analysis and design
- main actors in this phase are the developers (SDE)

- There are 2 types of developers

1. Frontend developers: They built all the components of the software that we see on our screen

- UI developers
- UI => User Interface
- Use tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- HTML
- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
- HTML uses tags to created the structure of the page
- HTML is a programming language

- CSS
- CSS stands Cascading Style Sheet
- We use CSS for the design and styling of the website page (color, font, styles, layout etc)

- CSS can not be used without HTML
- CSS to describe the way HTMl elements displayed on a website
- CSS is not a programming language

- JavaScript
- it is used to control the behavior of different elements
- It used with HTML and CSS
- It is a programming language that allows developers to change the HTML and CSS components of the web elemnts to meet requirements

- JavaScripts makes websites user friendly. Ex: it is used for menus, animations, 2D -3D graphics, maps, video players etc.


BACKEND DEVELOPERS

- They built all the components of the website that we don't see

- Tools they use: Java, C, C++, Pyhton, C#

FULL STACK DEVELOPERS
- They can do both frontend (UI), backend part of the software (application)



SDET vs QA (Software Development Engineer in Test vs Qaulity Assurance)
-QA does manual testing
-SDET can do both manual and automation testing


Why we need automation?
-Manual testing is consuming time and money for the companies
-The reason for that is tests are run by human manually
-Human errors can happen with manual testing
-Automation can be done with set of tools
-And all tests can be automated and this will save time and money for the company
-Automation testing is more reliable as it eliminates human errors

Manual: QA/QE/Quality Assurance/ Quality Engineers/ Quality Analyst/ Tester/ Test Engineer

Automation: SDET/ Software Development Engineer in Test/ Automation Tester/ Automation Test Engineer



BINARY CODE

-It is the language of computer
-Computer understands only ones and zeros


ASCII
-ASCII is a system that represents every letter, number, special characters
-Without ASCII, we would not be able to read anything from computer.


-Binary code is the computer language and it is made of ones and zeros.
-ASCII code is used for conversion


PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
-It is the way to communicate with computer and tell what to do
-Learning a programming language is similar to learning a natural language
-Natural language has grammar while programming language has syntax
-Programming language ambiguity and it will fail with that. 
-I saw the guy with a telescope. Who has the telescope?

NOTE: Programming Language will be looking for exact and clear instructions.
