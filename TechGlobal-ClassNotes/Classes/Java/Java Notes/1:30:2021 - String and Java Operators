STRING
-Primitives - > 8 primitives
-numbers -> byte, short, int, long
-floating numbers  -> float, double
-booleand -> true or false
-char -> a single character - > 'A', '$' , ' '

What if I want to store "TechGlobal"?

-If you can not store data in primitives, then use Objects
-String is an object that stores sequence of a characters

-String name = "Name";

-String - first "S" shoul always be capital
-Value given should always be inside "" double-quotation


-PSEUDO CODE
-English like statements of our program
-Step by step definition of your code

Write a pseudo code for making a coffee
-Go to kitchen
-Hit water and make it hot
-Get a cup
-Put coffee inside your cup
-Fill your cup with hot water
-Mix it with a spoon
-ENJOY!!!


PSEUDO CODE of our program

-create a new class named as PrintMyInfo
-call main() method
-declare my variables firstName, lastName, DOB, address
-assign values into my variables
-print those values


---String concatenation

String concatenation = forming a new string that is the combination of multiple strings

There are 2 ways of string concatenation in java
1. by “+” operator
2. by concat() method

String s1 = "re";
String s2 = "think";
String s3 = "ing";

String s4 = s1 + s2 + s3; //s4 is holding the value of "rethinking"


-concat() method

String s5 = s1.concat(s2); //this is equal to s1 + s2, s5 is holding value of "rethink"

String s6 = s5.concat(s3); //"rethinking"

String s7 = s1.concat(s2.concat(s3)) = s1.concat(s2+s3)

package

main
code


public class HelloWorld{

	public static void main(String [] args){
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}


OPERATORS
-Special symbols that are used for:
Mathematical functions
Assignment statements
Logical comparison etc.

EX/ 1 + 4 
EX/ 5 * 6
EX/ int age = 45;

ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
= is the assignment operator

Examples:
int age = 45;   
String name = “Lionel”;


15 = 1*10 +5    remainder is 5
75 = 7*10 +5    remainder is 5


2+3 = 5

10-8 = 2

4*100 = 400

25/5 = 5


10%3 = 1    10 = 3*3 + 1 // 1 is the remainder

25%8 = 1    25 = 3*8 + 1 // 1 is the remainder

125%15 =    125 = 15*8 + 5 // 5 is the remainder

90 mins = 1 hour and an half

90%60 =     90 = 1*60 + 30
