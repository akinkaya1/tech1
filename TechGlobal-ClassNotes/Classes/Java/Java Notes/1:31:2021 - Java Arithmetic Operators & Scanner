Addition
+ sign is used
EX/ 3+5, 2+2


Subtraction
- sign is used
EX/ 5-2


Multiplication
* sign is used
EX/ 3*5 = 15
EX/ 125*8 = 1000
EX/ 16*9 = 144


Division
/ sign is used
EX/ 10/2 = 5
EX/ 95/5 = 19
EX/1250/50 = 25


Remainder or Modulus
% sign is used
EX/ 20 % 8 =>    20 = 8 * 2 + 4   -> 4 is the remainder
EX/ 1000 % 300 => 1000 = 300 * 3 + 100 -> 100 is the remainder

EX/ 15 % 20 => 15 = 20 * 0 + 15 -> 15 is the remainder

NOTE: if the first number less than second number, then the remainder is equal to first number

EX/ 154 % 200 => 154 = 200 * 0 + 154 -> 154 is the remainder


EX/ 20 % 20 => 20 = 20 * 1 + 0 -> 0 is the remainder
EX/ 5 % 5 => the raminder is 0

NOTE: if the first number equals to second number, then the remainder will be zero 


How we are going to calculate below statements?

int number1 = 5*3+6-8/2; 
number1 = 17;

5*3 = 15

15+6-8/2

8/2 = 4

15+6-4 = 17

EX/ 10-5+8 = 13
EX/ 10*6/2 = 30


EX/ 5+3*2 = ?

Solution steps
-Do multiplication first => 3*2 = 6
-Put 6 instead of 3*2 in your function => 5+6=11


EX/ (5+3)*2 = 16



NOTES:

In such function or calculation, there are rules to follow
-Do calculation in the parentheses first
-Do multiplication or division if there are any
-addition and subtraction comes as last


int number1 = 5*(3+6)-8/2; //41


Steps to find the result
-First is parentheses => 3+6 = 9
-Put this value of 9 instead of (3+6) => 5*9-8/2
-Do multiplication or division if there are any
-Multiplication => 5*9 = 45
-Division => 8/2 = 4
-Put those values instead of multiplication or division => 45-4
-Find the result => 45-4 = 41




SCANNER
-Scanner is the class used for reading data from  user
-To be able to use it, we should create an object of it
-It should be imported

CREATING A Scanner object
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

NOTE: new keyword is used to create a new object
NOTE: without new keyword I can't create new Object


We also have to import the Java classes that we are going to use in our programs

EX/ import java.util.Scanner;

NOTE: your import statements should always be bt package and class

import java.util.Scanner; => this will import Scanner class
import java.util.*; => this will import all the classes inside the util package


===> next() method

this is method is used to read next string from user

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(“Please enter a string”);
String str = scanner.next();
