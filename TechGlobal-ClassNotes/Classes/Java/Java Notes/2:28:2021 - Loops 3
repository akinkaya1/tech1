1.Conditional statements - if else - switch
2.String methods - data manipulation
3.Loops - saves a lot considering time and - less line of code
4.Collections - Array , ArrayList, List, Map
5.OOP concepts - Object Oriented Programming Concepts
	a.encapsulation
	b.inheritance
	c.abstraction
	d.polymorphism




WHILE LOOP
-Syntax:

while(test condition){
	//code block to be executed
}

-While loop is based on condition and it will execute the block of code while test condition true
-it will break loop, whenever condition turns to false

INFINITE LOOP: a loop will run forever
while(true){
	//run this code
}



while(false){
	System.out.println("This is while loop running");
}

!false -> true
!true -< false


NOTE:
I can run all the for loop programs in while loop


for(int i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
	//codes to run
}


int i = 0;
while(i <= 10){
	//codes to run
	i++;
}

--But, there are some specific programs that uses while rather than for loop
These are mostly the programs that we don't know the exact iteration number


ITERATION: how many times loop will run


DO WHILE LOOP

while(test condition){
	//code block to be executed
}

Syntax:

do{
	//code block to be executed
}
while(test condition);




PSEUDO CODE for do while practice 1
-Create a scanner object
-Ask user to enter a number
-Check the number if 10 or less or more
-Ask user to enter numbers until user enters a number that is more than or equal to 10


LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS
1. break;
break is used to terminate the loop

2. continue;
continue is used to skip only current iteration if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop
