-Scanner is a Java class
-We can use Scanner for reading data from user
-Scanner was located java.util package
-To be able use the Scanner, we first need to create an object of Scanner

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

-We have to also import Scanner class to be able to use it 

-new keyword is used whenever we are creating an object
EX/ Date date = new Date();   -> creating new Object

EX/ Cars anyCar = new Cars();


next() method
-this is a Scanner method
-it is used for reading string - sequence of characters
-it can read only 1 string
-it can read until the next space

EX of Strings
-12345
-#@$%@#$
-kug3425
-My age is 32



Variable declaration and assignment

1st way -> declaration and initialization

int age = 25; 

2nd way -> 

int age;   first declare your variable

age = 25;  then put value into your variable




String declaration and assigment
1st way -> 

String name = "Lionel"; assignment and putting initial value

2nd way ->

String name;   declaration

name = "Lionel";  assignment


name = scannerName.next();

NOTE: difference of String from char
-char can store only one character\

EX/ char dollarSign = '$';

-String can store multiple characters - sequence of character

EX/ String city = "Chicago";




-nextLine() method

-next() is used to read only one string and it is until first space
EX/ I love pepsi!   -> this will take only "I"

-nextLine() is used to read whole line
EX/ I love pepsi!                                                     


NOTE: if you are using nextLine() method after next() method
Then, be careful! 
To do this, you have to move your scanner one line!!!

EX/ myScanner.nextLine(); //REMEMBER!! your scanner could be any name


nextInt()
-This is another Scanner method
-It can be used to store integers, numbers
