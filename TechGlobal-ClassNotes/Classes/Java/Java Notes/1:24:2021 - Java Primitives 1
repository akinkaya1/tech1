SOME Questions
1. A sample test case
	TechGlobal logo, name and motto or tagline
	1. When user navigates to www.techglobalschool.com
	2. Then user should be able to see our logo, name, motto
	3. And our logo should be on top-left of the page
	4. And our name and motto should be next to our logo and different lines

	***main page should have logo, motto, and company name
	Where they will be taking place?
	Their colors?


2. What do we do in SDLC phases, in maintanence?
-Fixing the bugs
-We are in every phase of SDLC


Java has JDK, JRE, JVM

JVM allows us to run the program
Our program will be executed from top to bottom and left to right


COMMENTING OUT IN JAVA
-Commands are used for explanations
// is used to comment out a single line
/* some lines of code */ is used to comment out multiple lines

	/*
    print your DOB using print
    print your favorite color using print
    print your name and last name in separate lines using println
     */

    System.out.println(); //we use this to just move cursor to a new line

  Where do we get requirements?
  -Different tools used for project management
  -JIRA: we will learn this tool in our soft skill classes
  -


  SPECIAL CHARACTERS in println()
  \n -> this will enable us to move our cursor to a new line

  EX: 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Name: Volkan\nLastName: Gurler\nDOB: 12/12/1985\nFavorite color: red");
    }

  \t -> insert a tab (space)

  NOTE: we can use + sign to concatenate separate texts - data types
  EX/ "Lionel" + " " + "Messi" -> return Lionel Messi

  System.out.println("\tHey, this is Akin, and I am from Chicago. I have been working in"
                + "\nIT field for a long time."
                + "\n\tChicago is really cold during winters, but it is nice in the summers."
                + "\nIts population is over 2 million.");


  \\ -> is used to insert a back slash "\"
  EX/ System.out.println("abc\\xyz"); -> result = abc\xyz

  \" -> is used to insert a double quotation "
  EX/ System.out.println("ap\"p\"le"); -> result = ap"p"le


  PRIMITIVES
  -There are 8 primitive data types
  -byte, short, int and long are used for numeric data 
  	EX/ 100, 45, 30000000, -45000

  -float and double can be used for numeric data but they have floating points
  EX/ 10.5  70,4375 -89.99

  -char to store every single character
  EX/ 'A' , '1' , '$'

  -boolean
  - it will store either true or false
