 String manipulation
 -Changing the given string

methods questions
What does this method takes? arguments
What does this method returns?

NOTE: arguments are the parameters that we type inside the method (inside the paranthesis)

String.valueOf(aBoolean);
What does this method takes: aBoolean
What does this method returns: String


1.valueof(variable) (This is only for String.valueOf())
-this method takes a variable which can be any primitive or some objects
-it will return the string representation of that data type

2.concat(stringVariable)
-it takes a string
-it returns a string


3-equals(stringVariable)
-it takes a string
-it returns a boolean (true or false)

Lionel = Ronaldo -> false
A = B            -> false
C = c            -> false
123 = 123        -> true
525 = 525#       -> false
Java = JaVa      -> false


INTERVIEW QUESTION!!!
== vs equals() method

== is going to check the values location
location is where the value of string is stored in the memory

equals() method is checking the values which is right way
equals() method is more reliable

DO NOT USE == EVER NEVER to compare strings if they are equal or not


4. equalsIgnoreCase()
-It compares 2 strings whether they are equal or not and return a boolean but it will ignore cases
it takes a string
it returns a boolean / true or false
NOTE: it is pretty much same as equals() method but this will ignore the capital or lower cases

					equals()	equalsIgnoreCase()
HeLLO = hello   -> 	false 		true
A = a 			->  false 		true
Java = selenium ->  false 		false



5. toLowerCase()
-It will take string and return it back with all letters to be lower case
-What it takes? it takes string
-What it returns? it returns string
NOTE: it does not take any arguments inside the paranthesis


6. toUpperCase()
-It will take string and return it back with all letters to be upper case
-it takes a string
-it returns a string
NOTE: it does not take any arguments inside the paranthesis



EXAMPLE TO MAKE 2 STRINGS EQUAL TO EACH OTHER

1.TechGlobal
2.TECHglobal

1. by using equalIgnoreCase() method, those 2 strings will be equal and return true

2.Convert those 2 strings into their lowercase style and compare. This will return true
techglobal = techglobal

3. Convert those 2 strings into their uppercase style and compare. This will return true
TECHGLOBAL = TECHGLOBAL
