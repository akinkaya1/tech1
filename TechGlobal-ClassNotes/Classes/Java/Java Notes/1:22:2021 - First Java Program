-JAVA Architecture

-Java is a programming language
-Syntax is the grammar of programming languages
-Java is consist of JDK, JRE, JVM (JIT in JVM)
-Java has JVM and it makes it platform independent

-Write Once Run Everywhere (WORE)

JDK = JRE + JVM + Development tools (javac and more tools)
JDK stands for Java Development Kit
	javac = java compiler
	javac is used to check syntax and give feedbacks

JRE = JVM + Libraries
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment

JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine
JVM makes Java platform-independent
JVM takes Byte code and turns it into machine code (binary code)
JVM has JIT (Just In Time Compiler)
JVM itself is platform - dependent
JIT is used to make execution faster


-Source code -> is the code that written by using any programming language
-Byte code -> it is specific Java, and it is compiled source code
-Binary Code -> Machine(Computer) Language



Source code -> compiled by javac -> Byte Code -> JVM -> Binary Code

javac compiles .java file and returns .class file
.class file has the Byte Code

EX/ MyFirstProgram.java (Source code)-> javac -> MyFirstProgram.class (Byte code) -> java -> Result of the program on my screen

javac -> compiles the source code
java -> runs the compiled code



COMMAND LINE
-Computer - is a device (machine) that takes instructions (commands) and returns some results
-Command line to give computer some instructions
-Command line is an area that we can use to give commands to computer
-Terminal for MAC machines
-Command Prompt (cmd) for Windows Machine - Powershell

NOTE - command+space for MAC will bring seacrh bar


COMMON COMMANDS
1. cd anyDirectoryName -> change directory
2. cd .. -> go back to parent directory
3. cd / -> go back to Home Directory
4. clear (for MAC) / cls (for Windows) -> clears command line
   clear does not affect your working directory (where you are)
5. pwd -> print working directory -> tell me where I am
6. ls (for MAC) / dir (for Windows) -> gives us a list of directories in the current directory
7. mkdir anyDirectoryName-> make directory, this is  used to create directory
	DIRECTORY = FOLDER
8. rm -rf anyDirectoryName (rd for windows) -> remove directory, this will delete directory


NOTE = if the directory name has multiple words, the we use "" and we put directory name inside those "" (double quotation)




NOTE = It does not matter what machine you use right now. We have to know both!!!

IntelliJ
-Created a new project and we selected Java
-we name the project name - package name - class names all one word
-we use camelCase method - this is the proper way

-package name could be anything but it is mostly preferred to start with lowercase / myFirstProgram / techGlobalStudents / newWorld

-class naming: it always start with uppercase and follows camelCase
-Ex/ HelloWorld / MyFirstProgram


main() method
-it is the starting of a java program
-without main() method, we can not run any code

method is a java component to do some specific job, function
println() -> prints whatever given to it


SHORT-Cuts

main + enter -> is going to type main() method
sout + enter -> is going to type System.out.println();
