- If else statements - conditional statements
- They are used to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions

Syntax:

if(condition){
	//execute a code if condition is true
}

System.out.println("....continue with program");


Syntax:

if(condition){
	//execute a code if condition is true
}
else{
	//execute this code if above condition is false
}


NOTE: One of the very common mistake that is done

if(condition);{
	//execute a code if condition is true
}

Do not use ; after your condition
Because ; ends the statement



NOTE: 
int number = input.nextInt();
input.nextLine();


Whenever you used nextInt(), nextDouble(), next() etc
Always give Scanner a next line with nextLine() method

EXAMPLE:
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Please enter a number");
        int number = input.nextInt();
        input.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Please enter your DOB"); // My DOB is 11/11/1990
        String dateOfBirth = input.nextLine();

        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Results");
        System.out.println("The number entered is: " + number);
        System.out.println("The DOB entered is: " + dateOfBirth);



NOTE: if can be used without else
BUT else can not be used without if

Below code will not compile
else{
	//any code
}



IF ELSE SHORT CUT WITH ONE STATEMENTS

		int number = 10;
        
        if(number > 0){
            System.out.println("Number is positive");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("Number is not positive");
        }
        
        /*
        Instead of above statement, a short cut can be used
        This can be done if there is only one statement in the if and else blocks
         */

        if(number > 0) System.out.println("Number is positive");
        else System.out.println("Number is not positive");




        DEBUG - TroubleShoot
        -these terms are used for the way to find the issue
        -You try to find the root cause for the issue
        -Fix it or make sure it is fixed

        HOW TO DEBUG OUR CODE?
        1. put a break-point in the line that you want to see with your code
        2.Instead of run, select debug for execution, this break-point is where my debug will start
        3. My execution of code will stop at the line that I put break-point
        4.After that, run your code line by line using Step Over button
