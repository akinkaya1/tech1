-Array is used store multiple same data type
-Element is each data that we store in an array
-length is used to find how many elements we have in an array
-Why we sort an array - easy to manage - easy to find smallest and greatest - ordered data


HOW TO FIND OUT IF AN ARRAY HAS A ELEMENT OR NOT
-First way is to loop through each element and check one by one. If, any element matches with given key, then it means array has that element.

-Second way is to use binarySearch() method
-This method will check if array has given key or not
-If it founds the given key, then it will return the position (index) of the key  (0 to length-1)
-Position can never be negative
-If this method returns a negative result, then it means key is not found in the array

NOTE: You can not use binarySearch() method with unsorted arrays
-If you are going to use this method, FIRST YOU NEED TO SORT YOUR ARRAY

-binarySearch(array, key)
it takes an array and a key as arguments
it returns index as int

-Arrays class has method called binarySearch() and it can be used to search for an element in an Array
-Searching is possible ONLY IF array is already sorted
binarySearch() method always returns an integer and it is the index of found element

-The result that  binarySearch() method returns could be as below:
1. If element is found in sorted array, then the index of element that we are looking for will be returned
2. If element is not found in sorted array, then a negative number will be returned - (insertion point) - 1
3. If binarySearch() method performed with unsorted array, then result is unpredictable (any number)
4. If element found but element occurs two or more times within an array, then it returns the last index of element


MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY

-Arrays we have learned till now are called one-dimensional arrays. However, we can declare multidimensional arrays in Java
A multidimensional array is an array containing one or more arrays
Multidimensional arrays are useful for creating tables
When declaring two dimensional arrays, we don't have to set inner array sizes because subarray(inner array) can be any size for each outer array
If we set inner size when declaring the two-dimensional array, that means all inner array sizes are same
