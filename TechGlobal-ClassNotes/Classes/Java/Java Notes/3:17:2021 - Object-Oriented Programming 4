Learning Object â€“ Class



METHOD
- Class member
- Methods are used run a specific task
- 2 types of methods - void - return
- Reusability of code

METHOD OVERLOADING
-In Java, multiple methods in class can have same name
-Those methods having names are known as overloaded methods
-HOW YOU CAN ACHIEVE OVERLOADING
-Different parameters
 1. different data type of parameters
 2. different number of parameters


 NOTE: it is not possible to achieve method overloading with changing return type


 METHOD SIGNATURE
-methodName(args)


STATIC METHOD
-Static methods can be called with class name
-We don't need to create an object those methods
EX/ println(), print()
valueOf()
isDigit(), isLetter()
sort(), binarySearch(), toString


Static method vs non-static method
-static methods are created with static keyword
-we can call non-static methods with object that is why we always need to create object of that class first
-we can call static methods with Class name right away, that is why we don't need to create objects to call static methods
