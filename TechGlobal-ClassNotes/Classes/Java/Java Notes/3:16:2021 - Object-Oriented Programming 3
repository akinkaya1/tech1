Learning Object – Class

Class = It is a blueprint or template that enable us to create many objects

Object = It is an instance of class


How we can create object?

Syntax: ClassName variableName = new ClassName();

Random r =  new Random();

-Constructor is a special method of class enable us to create objects of that class
-Constructor always comes after new keyword
-We can not create objects without new keyword and constructors

INSTANCE VARIABLES
-it is one the class members
-it is attributes - features - charecterictics of an object
-Also known as fields

-final instance variables -> are the fields that will have initial value and this initial value cannot be changed
-static instance variables -> those variables can be accessed just with the Class name, you don't need to create an object

Integer.MAX_VALUE; -> static and final


METHODS
-It is also one of the class members
-They are used to run a specific task
-There are 2 types of method - void and return types
void methods do not have any return type


METHOD OVERLOADING
-In Java, two or more methods  may have the same name

-This is allowed if they differ in parameters (different number of parameters, different types of parameters, or both). 

-These methods are called overloaded methods and this feature is called method overloading

-Note: Multiple methods can have the same name if the number and/or type of parameters are different

HOW TO ACHIEVE METHOD OVERLOADING
-Method overloading is achieved by either:
-changing the number of arguments
-or changing the data type of arguments
-argument = parameter
