Where does BA stands in this?

Business guys do not have technical skills but developers will do the technical job.

BA or PO is the person who can be a bridge between business and developers (non-technical and technical)

RE-ASSIGNMENT

1. int age = 45;

2. int age;

   age = 45;

   System.out.println(age);  // 45


   age = 27;

   System.out.println(age);  // 27


   -JAVA reads our code from top to bottom and left to right
   -At the last line it will always return the last assigned value



   -GARBAGE COLLECTOR
   -Every value that lose reference to it will be deleted by GarbageCollector
