NOTES to find first and the last words in a String

EX/ 
String str = " TechGlobal teaches Java ";

String firstWord = str.substring(0,str.indexOf(" "));

int indexOfFirstSpace = str.indexOf(" "); // 10

String lastWord = str.substring(str.lastIndexOf(" ") + 1);

int indexOfLastSpace = str.lastIndexOf(" ") + 1;


HOW TO DEBUG:
1. First, define the line that you will start debugging
   Put a breakpoint (red circle next to the line)
2. Watch you program step by step



WHY WE NEED LOOPS?
-Loops are used to run a block of code again and again
-Each run (circle or loop) is called as iteration (times)
-Loops in Java are used to execute a block of code repeatedly
-Loops will run until a termination condition is met
-Loops are helpful to eliminate duplicating codes and time saving

Syntax:

for(initialization; termination condition; change){
	//code block to be executed
}

NOTES:
-There are 3 steps to follow to create a for loop
1. The loop must have initialization point
2. There should be a termination point (condition) where loop ends
3. Change â€“ increment or decrement value
