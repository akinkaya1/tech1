Wrapper Classes 
-Object represantitives of primitives
-They can handle everyhing primitives does
-AND also, they provide useful methods that can not be provided by primitives

ARRAY
-It is a collection
-It is used to store multiple data - same type of data
-String array, int array - char array
-You can store primitives as well as objects in Arrays
-Syntax;
DECLARATION: String[] names; int[] ages;
INITIALIZATION : String[] names = {"Bahar", "Kaan"};

INDEXES:

String[] names = new String[3]; initial size of 3
names[0] = "Murat";
names[2] = "Volkan";
names[1] = "Dajve";

HOW TO PRINT OUT AN ARRAY
System.out.println(names); // [8734jhgfs   -> position or location
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(names)); -> [Murat, Dajve, Volkan]

String namesString = Arrays.toString(names);


for(int i = 0; i < names.length; i++){
	System.out.println(names[i]);
}

Murat
Dajve
Volkan

HOW TO FIND THE LENGTH OF THE ARRAY
-Basically, it is the count of elements inside array
-We can find length of array by using length method
int lengthOfNamesArray = names.length; // 3
-THIS DOES NOT HAVE PARANTHESES

HOW TO GET FIRST AND LAST ELEMENTS IN AN ARRAY?
-First element is always at the index of zero - names[0]
-Last element is always at the index of array -lenght- 1 )  
-> names[names.length-1]

WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BT length and length()
-length() is a String method and it returns an int
-Basically, it will tell how many characters in the string
EXAMPLE: 
String name = "Lionel";
int lengthOfName = name.length(); // 6

-length is the method used to find the length of an array
-It does not have paranthesis
-It will also return an int
-Basically, it will tell how many elements in the array
EXAMPLE:
int[] ages = {23, 45, 67, 89};
int lengthOfAgesArray = ages.length; // 4




LOOPS
1.fori - i loop - traditional loop - traditional i loop - for loop
2.while loop
3.do-while loop
4.for each

FOR EACH LOOP
-It is very common to use this loop with collections
-For each loop in Java is used to loop through each element in an array and other collections in Java

Syntax:
for(dataType element: array){
	//code of block to execute
}

-It will execute the block of code for each element
-It can be stopped only with break;
-Also, some elements can be skipped with continue;
-It will always run in an ascending order (from first to last)
-It is less flexible compared to fori loop


SOME OTHER COLLECTIONS
-ArrayList
-List
-Map
-Set
