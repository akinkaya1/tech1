=

1. Assigment operator
- we can assign values into variables and object using equal sign
EX/ int age = 25;
	int is data type - primitive data type
	age is the variable
	25 is the value
	dataType variableName = value;

EX/ String address = "Chicago";
	String is an object
	address is the name of String object
	"Chicago" is the assigned value to the address object

int age;  -> declaration
age = 45; -> assignment

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
Date date = new Date();

-Scanner is java class and also an object
-input is the name of Scanner object

NOTE: print(), println() are methods
next(), nextLine(), nextInt()

2. Shorthand assigment operators
-mostly used with numbers for math operators
+=
-=
*=
/=
%=

-BUT += can be used for String as well for concatenation purpose



3.Relational operators
-All relational operators will return a boolean/ true or false
>
<
EX/ 3 !> 5

>=
<=

EX/ 3 <= 5   same as  3 < 5 or 3 == 5   true
EX/ 5 <= 5   same as  5 < 5 or 5 == 5   true

==
!= not equal 

!true -> false
!false -> true


NOTE:
= is used to assign
== is to compare 2 things

3 == 3   -> true
3 == 5   -> false
3 !== 5   -> true

int age = 3;


4. Increment and decrement operators

int age = 10;

age++; // age 11 and 11 is put into age

post-increment -> age++;
pre-increment  -> ++age;

post-decrement -> age--;
pre-decrement  -> --age;

increment is used to increase value
decrement is used to decrease value


post - increase or decrease now but assign in the future

pre - inscrease or decrease now and also assign value 


NOTE: We usually post-increment or post-decrement



5. Logical operators
-There are 2 types of logical operators
-These will help us to check multiple conditions and they return a boolean all the time / true or false


AND OPERATOR
-AND is shown with & operator
Expected results
false && false 	- returns false
false && true	- returns false
true && false	- returns false
true && true 	- returns true

It will return true only if both conditions are true
It will return false if one or both conditions are false


- cold and weekdays -> I will stay at home
- 15 and 20 are dividable by 5 => true
- 15 and 20 are dividable by 3 => false

- 15 & 20 are dividable by 5 => true


OR Operator
-OR is shown with | (pipe) operator
Expected results
false && false 	- returns false
false && true	- returns true
true && false	- returns true
true && true 	- returns true

It will return false only if both conditions are false
It will return true if one or both conditions are true



condition 1 = sunny day
condition 2 = weekend
condition 3 = there is a game on weekend

sunny day && weekend && there is a game -> then I will go to game



condition 1 = java
condition 2 = selenium
condition 3 = experience
condition 4 = cucumber
condition 5 = singer



(5 < 10) && (10 > 76) -> false
(5 < 10) & (10 > 76) -> false


(10 > 76) && (5 < 10) -> false
(10 > 76) & (5 < 10) -> false




(3 == 5) || (10 != 20)  -> true

(10 != 20) || (3 == 5)  -> true



true && true && true && true && false && true -> false


false || false || true || false -> true




NOT Operator
-Shown with ! sign

Expected results
!false 	- returns true
!true	- returns false




Operations that returns boolean
> < >= <= == !=       -   relational operators
& | && || !           -   logical operators
