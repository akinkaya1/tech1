-WHAT IS ARRAY
-Array is also an object
-It is a collection
-It is used to store multiple same data type
-String[], int[], char[]
-It should always be started with a fixed size
-Initial size can not be changed

-HOW TO FIND THE SIZE OF AN ARRAY
-To be able to find the size of array,  we can use length method
-length method in array will tell us how many elements our array holds

EXAMPLE = char[] characters = new char[5];
int sizeOfArray = characters.length; // 5

System.out.println(sizeOfArray); // 5


-FOR EACH LOOP

int[] numbers = new int[5];

System.out.println(numbers[2]);  // 0

numbers[0] = 11;

System.out.println(numbers[0]);  // 11


numbers[3] = 25;
numbers[2] = 37;
numbers[4] = 45;

1.print all elements with fori loop

for(int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
	System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}

2.print all elements with for each loop

for(int element: numbers){
	System.out.println(element);
}


PRINTING ARRAYS OR IT'S ELEMENTS

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
[11, 0, 37, 25, 45]

System.out.println(numbers); // location or position of the array in my RAM
[2@435876


PRINT EACH ELEMENT
for(int element: numbers){
	if(element > 10) System.out.println(element);
}

null keyword
-Reserved keyword by Java
-null means an object variable is not pointing an object (value assigned to object)
-Primitives cannot be null
-If an object variable holds null, then it cannot be manipulated (methods cannot be used)
-If object variable holds null and programmer tries to execute some methods over null value, then NullPointerException will be thrown as a run-time error



FINDING SMALLEST AND GREATEST ELEMENTS IN AN ARRAY
-4, 8, 11, 58, 65, 0
-4, 0, 8, 11, 58, 65


HOW TO SORT ARRAYS
-we can also use sort() method

int[] numbers = {34, 45, 1, -7};

Arrays.sort(numbers); // -7, 1, 34, 45

-Sorting an array means ordering elements inside an array
-Sorting is very useful to find max and min int values
-Arrays class has method called sort() and it can be used to sort array elements
-Sorting can be used for String, char and other data types as well

NOTES:
-When you sort characters and strings, it will be done based on ASCII
-sorting numbers returns array sorted from smaller to bigger
-sorting words or characters returns array sorted lexicographically 
A to Z
a to z
0 to 9
