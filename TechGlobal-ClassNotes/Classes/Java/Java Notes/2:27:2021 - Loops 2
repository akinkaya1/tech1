RECAP-

-Loops are going to allow us execute a block of code repeatedly

1. For loop (i loop) (traditional loop)

Syntax:
3 important points 
1.start point (initialization point)
2.end point (termination) - condition
3.update (post-decrement or post-increment)

for(int i = 0; i <= 100; i++){
	// execute code here
}



= vs == (equal vs ==)
= is used assign values

String name = "Lionel";
int age = 45;

== is used for comparison

5 == 5  -> true



NOT OPERATOR (!)

!true -> false
!false -> true


HOW TO FIND EVEN OR ODD NUMBERS

number % 2 == 0   -> EVEN
number % 2 == 1   -> ODD
number % 2 != 0   -> ODD
