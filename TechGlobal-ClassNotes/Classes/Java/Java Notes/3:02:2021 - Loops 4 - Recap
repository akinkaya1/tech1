RANDOM CLASS
-Random is a Java class that allows us to create random data
-To be able to use random, I need to create an OBJECT of Random class first.

- "new" keyword in Java is always used to create any object like Scanner, Date, Random, Wrapper classes

EX
Integer age = new Integer(45); // int age = 45;

1. HOW TO CREATE A RANDOM CLASS OBJECT

Random numberGenerator = new Random();

int firstNumber = numberGenerator.nextInt(26); // one number that is between 0 and 25 (0 and 25 are included)

int secondNumber = numberGenerator.nextInt(26);

2. Find out which random number is greatest and which is smallest
A. find greatest and smallest by using if else statement
int greatest;
int smallest;

if(firstNumber < secondNumber){
	greatest = secondNumber;
	smallest = firstNumber;
}
else{
	greatest = firstNumber;
	smallest = secondNumber;
}

B. find greatest and smallest by using ternary operator
Ternary operator
int greatest = firstNumber < secondNumber ? secondNumber : firstNumber;

int smallest = firstNumber > secondNumber ? secondNumber : firstNumber;

B. find greatest and smallest by using Math max and min methods
int greatest = Math.max(firstNumber, secondNumber);
int smallest = Math.min(firstNumber, secondNumber);


3. loop all the numbers between those

for(int i = smallest; i <= greatest; i++){
	
}


int number = 12321;
String s = String.valueOf(number);
