-Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value
-Array is one of the collection types in java
-Collection is storing multiple similar items in one place
-By using an Array, we can store many similar items/elements in one variable

-To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets

// declaration of arrays
        int[] ages; // declaration of an int array
        char[] characters; //  declaration of a char array

        //NOT preferred ways of creating arrays
        String [] lastNames;
        String addresses [];

NOTE:
When we create an array object, we should always define the size
EX/ String[] names = new String[anySize]; 
String[] states = new String[52]; 

Size is a number and it is going to be array's length
If we do not provide size, it will give us compiler error


ELEMENTS of an Array
-Any data value that we put in our array container is known as element



INITIALIZATION OF ARRAY
First way - long way
char[] characters = new char[4];

        characters[0]= 'A';
        characters[1]= '3';
        characters[2]= '%';
        characters[3]= '+';

Second way - short
char[] characters = new char[]{'A', '3', '%', '+'};

SAME AS BELOW

char[] characters = {'A', '3', '%', '+'};


*** IMPORTANT INFORMATION
if you know the initial values go with 
char[] characters = {'A', '3', '%', '+'};

if you don't know initial values but you know the size
int[] numbers = new int[4];

if you don't know size or what values to store
Then you may not use array but other collections


***In Java, each Array has below features:
1.Data type
2.Name
3.Size

EX/
int[] numbers = new int[3];
char[] characters = {’A’, ‘x’, ‘$’, ‘#’};

Size of array is equal to how many elements you have in the array


HOW TO PRINT AN ARRAY
-Arrays class have a toString() method and it will enable us to print any array (int array, String array)

toString(array);
It takes an array
It returns a String
What argument it takes: array


EXAMPLE:
String[] cities = {"Chicago", "Miami", "LA"};

System.out.println(cities); // this is the position (location) array

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(cities)); // How to print the array
