Learning Object â€“ Class


Class -> It is a blueprint or template that we create objects from.

Object -> Instance of a class.

Class members:
1.Instance variables - fields -> attributes or characteristics

2.Methods - functions

3.Constructor

Random r = new Random();
Car tesla = new Car();

4.Blocks

{
	//some code
}

if(){
	
}

switch(enum){
	
}

for(){
	
}

final keyword with instance variables: 
2 RULES to make some instance variables final
1. You need to give it a value
2. final keyword should come in front of the field

-> final instance variables cannor be changed anywhere as it is final


static keyword with instance variables:
-static keyword is making fields more accessible
-static fields can be accessed immediately with class name
ClassName.   -> will show the static members



Create a class of "Animal"
Create instance variables for Animal class as below:

String color
String family
String gender
String size
boolean carnivore   -> lion - tiger
boolean herbivore   -> cow
boolean omnivore    -> bears


Create a AnimalTest class and create 3 objects
Define all atributes for those objects


CLASS METHODS
-A method is a block of code that performs a specific task
toLowerCase() -> converts all letters to lowercase
charAt(index) -> return char at given index 

-Methods are functions or behaviors of the class
-If we have Animal as class, move, sleep, eat would be functions of that class

if we have Phone as class, ring, call, playingMusic, dial would be functions of that class

-There are void and return types of methods

Syntax:
accessModifier returnType methodName(){ 
	// method body
 }

public void printName(String name){
	System.out.println(name);
}


Creating Methods
-Is it going to return something or not
-Is it taking any parameter - argument
-Is it static or not
